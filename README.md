# CHRONOS 2.0: Contextual Temporal Intelligence System

## Project Overview

Chronos 2.0 is a personal digital intelligence system designed to capture, process, and analyze your entire digital existence with a focus on contextual awareness and temporal navigation. By integrating temporal data streams with semantic understanding, the system provides intelligent navigation across your digital life while surfacing relevant past experiences based on your current context.

## Vision Statement

To create an intelligent temporal navigation system that understands the semantic meaning of your digital activities, enabling you to explore your past experiences contextually and receive timely, relevant insights based on your current situation.

## Security Considerations

While privacy is not a primary concern as you are the sole user, security remains important:

```python
class SecurityMeasures:
    def __init__(self):
        self.measures = {
            "data_transmission": {
                "encryption": "End-to-end encryption for all data in transit",
                "protocols": ["HTTPS", "TLS 1.3", "Secure WebSockets"],
                "authentication": "API key and token-based authentication"
            },
            "data_storage": {
                "encryption": "At-rest encryption for all stored data",
                "access_control": "Strong authentication for server access",
                "backup": "Encrypted backup strategies"
            },
            "client_security": {
                "android": "Local encryption, secure storage APIs, app permissions management",
                "mac": "Keychain integration, sandboxed execution, secure local storage",
                "browser": "Isolated extension storage, minimal permissions model"
            },
            "server_security": {
                "hardening": "Regular security updates, minimal attack surface",
                "monitoring": "Intrusion detection, activity logging",
                "deployment": "Containerized services, network isolation"
            }
        }
```

## Example Use Case: Conversation Memory Recall

```
1. You're having a conversation with a friend about a trip:
   "I can't remember the name of that restaurant we went to in Bangkok last year..."

2. Android Collector:
   - Records conversation audio
   - Performs local speech-to-text
   - Identifies entities: "restaurant", "Bangkok", "last year"
   - Detects intent: memory recall difficulty
   - Transmits context to server

3. Remote Server:
   - Processes context information
   - Queries knowledge graph for:
     * Restaurants visited in Bangkok
     * Time period: approximately 1 year ago
     * Associated with this friend (based on photo co-occurrence, etc.)
   - Finds match: "You visited Gaggan Anand in Bangkok on June 15, 2023"
   - Generates notification
   - Sends to Android device

4. Android App:
   - Displays notification: "You visited Gaggan Anand restaurant in Bangkok with Alex on June 15, 2023"
   - Prepares context navigation

5. When notification is tapped:
   - Opens to context view showing:
     * Photos from the restaurant
     * Map location
     * Related memories from the Bangkok trip
     * Other times this restaurant was mentioned
   - Allows further exploration of the memory context
```

## Core Usage of Chronos 2.0
